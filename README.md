# Web Dev Portfolio Website

This project is a personal portfolio website built to re-learn and practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in their most basic (vanilla) forms. The goal is to create a clean, functional, and visually appealing website, with an Agile approach to iteratively adding new features and improvements.

## Agile Workflow

Tasks are organized into **Ongoing** (active work) and **Future Enhancements** (planned tasks) to support a flexible, iterative process where new ideas can be prioritized as they come up.

- **Ongoing**:
  - Fixing mobile compatibility and responsiveness.
  - Enhancing button and link styles to align with the dark theme.
  
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Adding more UI/UX improvements.
  - Expanding functionality in the Projects section with JavaScript to dynamically display projects.
  - Improving accessibility for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Basic structure and layout.
- **CSS3**: Dark theme, styling, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript** (planned): Basic interactivity in the Projects section.
- **Vite**: Development tooling for a faster development process.
- **Git**: Version control to track progress and updates.
- **Netlify**: Hosting and deployment for easy access and continuous deployment.
